<h3>Group Members</h3>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
The RMO is a non-profit organization and one of the largest folk orchestras in Canada. They have a website at http://www.mandolin.ca, with a public and members only side. They are currently facing many issues related to communication, and are looking for an upgraded website to deal with these concerns.

We are a team of threee students enrolled in ENSE 271, tasked with redesigning and upgrading the website. This repository contains all the project work and information related to this project.
