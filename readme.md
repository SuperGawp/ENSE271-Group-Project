<h3>Project Description</h3>
The Regina Mandolin Orchestra (RMO) is a democratic, member-run, nonprofit group registered in Saskatchewan. The RMO was officially organized in 1988 with 10 members and one mandolin student. It emerged as a unique performing ensemble that is today one of the largest folk orchestras in Canada. The members of the RMO have come from many musical backgrounds and experiences. Several musicians have performed together in other groups and have travelled extensively to perform in concerts, festivals and stage presentations.
